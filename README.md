#### Project_Report_Group-1
Land use classification using sentinel 2 imagery in GEE

#### Background

Sundarban the world’s largest mangrove forest delta covering India to Bangladesh, provides a wide range of ecosystem services and contributes to socio-economic development of the neighbouring communities. Agriculture is the main source of sustenance following rice based farming system for major part of this population. But there are huge area of potential farming land which are fallow in this region. The information of fallow area is lack to the policy planner which is important to make comprehensive plan to secure the livelihood of the population. In this project, land use classification will be done through which total fallow area of ‘Gosaba’ block located in Indian part will be estimated and delineated in map.

#### Objectives:

With this project, we can compare the results of different supervised machine learning algorithm for the classification of land use of our study area.

    Study different supervised clssification algorithm In GEE and CRIB
    Accuracy assesement
    Select the best classification algorithm for fallow mapping purpose </i>
